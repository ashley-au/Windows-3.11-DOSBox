# Windows 3.11 in DOSBox
Just a method of running Windows 3.11 in DOSBox Stable release 0.74-2, for personal use.

The idea was inspired initially by my desire to re-visit some After Dark screen savers, and a recent discussion over at r/dosgaming. [https://www.reddit.com/r/dosgaming/comments/b4iufe/how_can_i_use_windows_311_on_a_modern_windows_7/]


To try it out, download the latest release archive.

Simply use the conf file from this archive to run with DOSBox.

If you are using D-Fend Reloaded, you can just install this package via File|Import|Import zip-file or by just dragging the zip file to the D-Fend Reloaded program window. Download D-Fend Reloaded here [http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/Download.html]

All required resources are contained in the included archive.
