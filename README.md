# Windows 3.11 in DOSBox
Just a method of running Windows 3.11 in DOSBox Stable release 0.74-2, for personal use.

It's not complete as of this update however a fully funtional Windows 3.11 desktop environment will be added shortly.

The idea was inspired initially by my desire to re-visit some After Dark screen savers, and a recent discussion over at r/dosgaming. [https://www.reddit.com/r/dosgaming/comments/b4iufe/how_can_i_use_windows_311_on_a_modern_windows_7/]

I've built dedicated hardware for this purpose previously but wanted to tailor something to my specific needs. Circa 1993/94 PhotoStyler 2.0 and PageMaker 5.0 were among my daily drivers so this is representative of the system I was most familiar. Also it had to be portable.

My thanks entirely to the efforts preceding me from the team behind DOSBox and also D-Fend Reloaded. I would not/could not have accomplished this without you.

To try it out, download the Windows 3.11 (4DOS 8.0) Public1.zip.
If you are using D-Fend Reloaded, you can just install this package via
File|Import|Import zip-file or by just dragging the zip file to the
D-Fend Reloaded program window.

If you do not have a D-Fend Reloaded installation on your system, you can
download it here [http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/Download.html]

You can also run the game from this package without having D-Fend Reloaded
installed. All you need is DOSBox [http://www.dosbox.com]. You can just use
the conf file from this folder to run the game inside DOSBox.

All resources are contained in the included archive [Windows 3.11 (4DOS 8.0) Public1.zip]
